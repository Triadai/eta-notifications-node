      ## Eta Notifications - Laundry On-Demand

      ![ETA Notifications](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/eta-notifications.png)

      There are a wide range of businesses that deliver goods or services to
      their customers on-demand. Companies like Uber, TaskRabbit, and
      Instacart have built an entire industry around the fact that we, the
      customer, like to order things instantly wherever we are. The key that
      make those services work is to be able to notify customers instantly when things
      change.

      On this tutorial we'll build a notification system for Laundr.io an
      on-demand laundry service.

      Let's get started!

      ## Trigger the Notifications

      This screen shows two buttons that allow the laundry delivery person to
      trigger notifications. There are two possibilities for this:

      1. Delivery person picks up laundry to be delivered.

      2. Delivery person arrived to the customer's house.

      On a production app we would probably trigger the second notification
      when the delivery person was physically near the customer using GPS. In
      this case we'll just use a button.

      On the server we're going to use the Twilio API Client to actually
      send out the notifications.

      ## Setting Up the Twilio REST Client

      Here we create a Twilio REST API
      client that we can use anytime we need to send a text message. We
      initialize it with our [Twilio Account
      Credentials](//www.twilio.com/user/account/settings) stored
      as environment variables.

    :markdown
      ## Handling the Notification Trigger

      This code handles the HTTP `POST` request triggered by the delivery
      person. It uses the `sendSmsNotification` method of our `Order` model
      to send an SMS message to the
      customer's phone number (which we have registered in our database).

      Next let's look closer at how we send the SMS.


  .step(data-title='Sending the Message', data-file='models/order.js', data-highlight='16-32')
    :markdown
      ## Sending the Message

      Here is the method that actually sends the sms. If we want to improve
      the message we can send a picture of the laundry by adding:

      ```
      'mediaUrl' : 'http://lorempixel.com/image_output/fashion-q-c-640-480-1.jpg'
      ```

      In addition to the required parameters, we can pass a `statusCallback`
      url to let us know if the message was delivered. Let's take a closer
      look at how this works.

  .step(
    data-title='Handling the Twilio Callback',
    data-file='routes/orders.js',
    data-highlight='51-62')
    :markdown
      ## Handling the Twilio Callback

      Twilio will make a post request to this controller each time our message
      status changes to one of the following: queued, failed, sent, delivered, or
      undelivered.

      We then update this `notificationStatus` on the order so that we decide
      what to do next with the order. This is a great place to add logic that would
      resend the message or send out an
      [automated survey](//www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/automated-survey/node/express).

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We've just implemented an on-demand notification service that
      alerts our customers when they're order is arriving.
